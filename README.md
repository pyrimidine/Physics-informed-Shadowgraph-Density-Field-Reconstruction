This repository contains the source code for the research paper *"Physics-Informed Shadowgraph Density Field Reconstruction"*.

### Overview
This code implements a physics-informed framework for reconstructing density fields from shadowgraph images. The approach combines shadowgraph imaging techniques with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to capture refractive index variations in complex flow fields accurately.

The video below demonstrates the on-time prediction. Due to the lack of high-performance GPU support on this laptop, the prediction process is relatively slow. (P.S.: Our model was definitely not trained on this laptop! ðŸ˜Š)

### Key Features
- **Shadowgraph Image Processing**: Pre-processing and analysis of shadowgraph images for density field visualization.
- **PINN Implementation**: Physics-informed neural network setup tailored for accurate density field reconstruction.
- **Density Field Reconstruction**: Algorithms for computing density distributions based on refractive index variations within the experimental field.

### Dataset
The data folder only contains a few example images. Its purpose is to illustrate what the shadowgraph image looks like. Training solely on this data will result in **significant overfitting**. A complete example dataset can be obtained by contacting the authors.
